# HQ-Vita-Shadows
ARM's Cubemap Based Shadows running on PSVita

This is just a demo with replaced models, originally this demo had chess pieces but those obviously didnt constantly move, only when you gragged them, now with these models the shadow is changing shape every frame.

I tested this implementation with up to 70k polys on screen approximately with no performance losses (Without OC, it stayed at 30 FPS).
This build runs about 20k polys on screen and runs at 30fps approximately without OC, but since this is capped at 60 fps, once you OC your Vita it reaches 60 FPS
